# Obsidian Terminal

I *love* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It's amazing to have a note-taking software that lets me work how I want to.

The only shortcoming of Obsidian is its Git integrations. There's a plugin, but I *really* prefer the terminal. And besides, having a terminal integration lets you do *everything!*

So I made this quick-and-dirty Obsidian Terminal :)

## 

## Development

No build system necessary-- no typescript; no `npm run dev`. 

~~no `require()` either because of how obsidian 'loads' plugins, but  that's okay~~
